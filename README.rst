Wolph's Dotfiles
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably too specific for my needs for people to use out of the box, but there
might be some nice things in here which you will like.

Have a look around, take what you need and please drop me a line if you have
any questions or simply like the scripts/settings/etc.

Cheers :)

Installation
==============================================================================

If you are brave enough to give it a try, the install is fairly simple:

::

    git clone git@github.com:berjan/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

Don't worry, it won't overwrite anything and only symlink the files to this
location if they don't exist yet. Trying is perfectly safe.

Uninstallation
==============================================================================

If you don't like it anymore, there's always the uninstall script.

::

    cd dotfiles
    ./uninstall.sh
